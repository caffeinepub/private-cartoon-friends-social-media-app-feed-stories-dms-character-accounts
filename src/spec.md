# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add video posting and live streaming capabilities, and fix messaging functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Add video upload and playback for posts with author selection (user or character)
- Implement live streaming for users and characters with viewer support
- Fix messaging to ensure conversations load, messages send reliably, and history persists

**User-visible outcome:** Users can post videos with captions, go live or watch live streams from characters, and send/receive messages without errors.
