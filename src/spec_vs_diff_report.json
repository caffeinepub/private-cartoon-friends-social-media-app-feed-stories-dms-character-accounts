  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all three requirements: video posting (REQ-1), live streaming (REQ-2), and messaging fixes (REQ-3). Video functionality includes upload, playback, and author selection. Live streaming features simulated broadcast capability with UI indicators. Messaging includes conversation loading, sending, and history persistence. However, the live streaming implementation appears to be a simulated/UI-only feature rather than actual video streaming infrastructure.",

      "description": "Simulated live streaming instead of actual video streaming capability",
      "reason": "The live streaming implementation uses simulated data (mock viewer counts, gradient backgrounds instead of video streams, setTimeout for auto-clearing) rather than actual video broadcast infrastructure. The BuildRequest explicitly requested live video broadcasting capability, but the implementation only provides UI scaffolding without real streaming functionality.",
