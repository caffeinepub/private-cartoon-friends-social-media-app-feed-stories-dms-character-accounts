  "summary": "Implemented a new ScrollableSelectContent wrapper and applied it to the author/sender Select dropdowns in PostComposer, CommentsPanel, CreateStoryDialog, and MessageThread. Added CSS to constrain dropdown viewport height and enable touch-friendly scrolling, plus visual chevron indicators that appear when the list can scroll.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add a clear scroll affordance to the open name dropdown list by showing a side scroll indicator/arrow controls when the list is scrollable.",
      "reason": "The implementation adds top/bottom overlay chevrons (indicators) but does not clearly implement a *side* scroll indicator/arrow control as described (e.g., on the right edge). While this may still be an acceptable affordance, the diff evidence does not show a side/right-edge indicator or explicit visible scrollbar thumb scoped to the dropdown only.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Global custom scrollbar styling for all scrollbars via ::-webkit-scrollbar rules (not limited to the dropdown).",
      "reason": "REQ-2 discusses scroll affordance for the Select dropdown list; the diff adds global scrollbar theming which affects the entire app, not just the name picker dropdown, and this broader styling change was not explicitly requested.",
