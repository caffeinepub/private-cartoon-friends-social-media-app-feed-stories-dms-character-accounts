  "summary": "The diff implements fixes across CreateConversationDialog, MessageThread, Messages.tsx, and useQueries.ts that address all four requirements. REQ-1 through REQ-4 are all covered: the dialog calls the backend, passes the ID back, Messages.tsx routes to MessageThread, and MessageThread has loading/error states. No obvious missing requirements or hallucinated features are detected based on available evidence.",
